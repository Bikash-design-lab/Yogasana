1. Gamify Wellness: The app should encourage users to engage in wellness activities (Yogasanas) by making it fun and competitive.
2. Community App: Users should be able to form social groups, share their progress, and interact with others.
3. Share Yogasanas: Users should log the number of Yogasanas theyâ€™ve done and share them with their group.
4. Rate Difficulty: Users should be able to rate the difficulty of each Yogasana.

Phase 1: Setup and Backend APIs (8 hours)
        Set up the project:
        Create a new React app (npx create-react-app frontend).
        Set up a Node.js + Express.js backend (express-generator or manually).
        Connect MongoDB to the backend.
        Create basic APIs:
        Yogasana API:
        GET /api/yogasana: Fetch all Yogasanas.
        POST /api/yogasana: Add a new Yogasana (for testing).
        Rating API:
        POST /api/rating: Add a rating for a Yogasana.
        GET /api/rating/:id: Fetch ratings for a specific Yogasana.
        Group API:
        POST /api/group: Create a new group.
        GET /api/group/:id: Fetch details of a specific group.
        Seed the database:
        Add some sample Yogasanas to the database for testing.

Phase 2: Frontend Development (8 hours)
        Create basic pages:
        Home page: Display a list of Yogasanas.
        Group page: Display group details and leaderboard.
        Yogasana page: Display details and allow logging/rating.
        Integrate APIs:
        Fetch Yogasanas from the backend and display them.
        Allow users to log Yogasanas and submit ratings.
        Basic styling:
        Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind for quick styling.

Phase 3: Gamification and Leaderboard (8 hours)
        Implement points system:
        Assign points for each Yogasana logged (e.g., 10 points per Yogasana).
        Store user points in the database.
        Leaderboard:
        Fetch and display the top users in a group based on points.
        Group functionality:
        Allow users to create and join groups.
        Display group-specific leaderboards.

Phase 4: Polish and Testing (8 hours)
        Improve UI/UX:
        Add loading states and error handling.
        Make the app responsive.
        Test APIs:
        Use Postman to test all backend APIs.
        Fix any bugs or issues.
        Test frontend:
        Ensure all features work as expected.
        Test on different devices (desktop, mobile).

Phase 5: Deployment and Final Touches (8 hours)
        Deploy the backend:
        Use Render or Heroku to deploy the Node.js backend.
        Update API endpoints in the frontend.
        Deploy the frontend:
        Use Vercel or Netlify to deploy the React app.
        Final testing:
        Test the deployed app end-to-end.
        Fix any last-minute bugs.
        Documentation:
        Write a brief README file explaining how to use the app.

Got it! Since you have **40 hours** to build the application and authentication can be implemented later, weâ€™ll focus on the **core functionality** and **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**. Here's a streamlined plan to help you build the app efficiently:

---

### **Streamlined Features for 40 Hours**
1. **Yogasana Logging**:
   - Users can log the number of Yogasanas theyâ€™ve done.
   - Display a list of Yogasanas with details (name, description, difficulty).

2. **Difficulty Rating**:
   - Users can rate the difficulty of each Yogasana (1 to 5 stars).
   - Display the average difficulty rating for each Yogasana.

3. **Social Groups**:
   - Users can create and join groups.
   - Display a group leaderboard based on points earned.

4. **Gamification**:
   - Points system: Users earn points for completing Yogasanas.
   - Leaderboard to show top users in a group.

5. **Basic UI**:
   - A clean and functional interface to log Yogasanas, view groups, and see leaderboards.

---

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React.js (for quick UI development).
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js (for APIs).
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing Yogasanas, groups, and ratings).
- **Deployment**: Use a quick hosting service like Vercel (frontend) and Render/Heroku (backend).

---

### **40-Hour Plan**
Letâ€™s break this into **5 phases**, each taking **8 hours**:

---

#### **Phase 1: Setup and Backend APIs (8 hours)**

### **Database Schema (Simplified)**
Since authentication is skipped, weâ€™ll use a simple schema:
1. **Yogasana**:
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     name: String,
     description: String,
     difficulty: Number // Average difficulty rating
   }
   ```

2. **Rating**:
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     yogasanaId: ObjectId, // References Yogasana
     rating: Number, // 1 to 5
     userId: String // Temporary user identifier (e.g., username)
   }
   ```

3. **Group**:
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     name: String,
     members: [String], // List of user identifiers
     leaderboard: [{ userId: String, points: Number }]
   }
   ```

---

### **APIs to Implement**
1. **Yogasana**:
   - `GET /api/yogasana`: Fetch all Yogasanas.
   - `POST /api/yogasana`: Add a new Yogasana.

2. **Rating**:
   - `POST /api/rating`: Add a rating for a Yogasana.
   - `GET /api/rating/:id`: Fetch ratings for a specific Yogasana.

3. **Group**:
   - `POST /api/group`: Create a new group.
   - `GET /api/group/:id`: Fetch details of a specific group.
   - `POST /api/group/:id/join`: Join a group.

---

### **Frontend Pages**
1. **Home Page**:
   - Display a list of Yogasanas.
   - Allow users to log Yogasanas and rate them.

2. **Group Page**:
   - Display group details and leaderboard.
   - Allow users to join groups.

3. **Yogasana Page**:
   - Display Yogasana details.
   - Allow users to log and rate the Yogasana.

---

### **Tips for Speed**
- Use pre-built UI components (e.g., Material-UI, Bootstrap).
- Use mock data initially to test the frontend while the backend is being developed.
- Focus on functionality first, then polish the UI.
